# 2/2 vs 4/4   
- 2/2 is felt as two minims (you hear TWO beats)   
- 4/4 is felt as four crotchets (you hear FOUR beats)   
   
   
- 2/2 is called "cut time"   
    - [Stress-Unstress Stress-Unstress] in a bar   
- 4/4 is called "common time"   
   
   
It's about the character of the music. 2/2 sounds more playful, 4/4 sounds more plodding.
